# VineAnalysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there is any bias in the paid reviews vs the unpaid reviews in musical instruments by reviewing the four and five star ratings with the primary focus being on the five star ratings. We only reviewed items that had more than 20 reviews and the helpful votes were greater than 50%
## Analysis
### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
•	There were a total of 13,539 votes for musical instruments from both vine and non-vine reviews

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
•	57% = 34/59 – Vine Reviews
•	56.9% = 7,678/13,480 – Non-Vine Reviews

## Summary
I do not believe there is any bias in the paid reviews for musical instruments since there are almost the exact same percentage for five-star reviews. 57% for Vine and 56.9% for Non-Vine.

If you consider the four- and five-star reviews (2,490 for unpaid, 15 for paid)

75% = ((2,490+7,678)/13,480)) unpaid and 83% = ((15+34)/59) shows some bias however, it’s unlikely that anyone would pay for someone to only give a four-star rating. 

To look into potential bias more, it would be better to determine if there was a lower star rating that was changed to a five-star rating at a later date.
